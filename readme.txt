Free Code Camp Front End Development Projects - Use the Twitchtv JSON API

Task: Create a web page which shows the user a list of Twitch.tv streamers and displays their streaming status.

User Stories:

- As a user, I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
- As a user, I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
- As a user, if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
- As a user, I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.

Created Using:

- HTML5
- Javascript
- jQuery
- CSS3
- Twitch.tv API
- Google fonts

Future Improvements:

- Comment code
- Introduce functionality to allow a user to search for and add streamers to the list
